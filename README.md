# HACKER RANK SOLUTIONS

This project contains some of my own solutions for Python problems in
[HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) website.

Despite most of the problems could be solved using simple scripts, I decided to
use functions (unless the problem required the minimum number of lines
possible -
[like this one](https://github.com/Jailtons7/hacker-ranck-solutions/blob/main/python/math_/triangle_quest.py))

To run any solution just execute
```shell
python <path-to-problem>
```

Some problems require numpy, so install it first:
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
